        The anatomy of Brontosaurus is well known, with fossils demonstrating
        that it was large, long-necked, and quadrupedal with a long tail
        terminating in a whip-like structure. The cervical vertebrae are notably
        extremely robust and heavily-built, in contrast to its lightly built
        relatives Diplodocus and Barosaurus. The forelimbs were short and stout
        whereas the hindlimbs were elongated and thick, supported respectively
        by a heavily built shoulder girdle and pelvis. Several size estimates
        have been made, with the largest species B. excelsus reaching up to
        21–22 m (69–72 ft) from head to tail and weighing in at 15–17 t (17–19
        short tons), whereas the smaller B. parvus only got up to 19 m (62 ft)
        long. Juvenile specimens of Brontosaurus are known, with younger
        individuals growing rapidly to adult size in as little as 15 years.
