        Velociraptor (commonly referred to as "raptor") is one of the dinosaur
        genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in
        the Jurassic Park films. In reality, however, Velociraptor was roughly
        the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the approximately 2 m
        (6.6 ft) tall and 90 kg (200 lb) reptiles seen in the novels and films
        (which were based on members of the related genus Deinonychus). Today,
        Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen
        described fossil skeletons. One particularly famous specimen preserves a
        Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops.Velociraptor (commonly referred to as "raptor") is
