          Velociraptor (commonly referred to as "raptor") is one of the dinosaur
          genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role
          in the Jurassic Park films. In reality, however, Velociraptor was
          roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the
          approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) tall and 90 kg (200 lb) reptiles seen in
          the novels and films (which were based on members of the related genus
          Deinonychus). Today, Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists,
          with over a dozen described fossil skeletons. One particularly famous
          specimen preserves a Velociraptor locked in combat with a
          Protoceratops.

        <h2>Brontosaurus</h2>

        <p>
          The anatomy of Brontosaurus is well known, with fossils demonstrating
          that it was large, long-necked, and quadrupedal with a long tail
          terminating in a whip-like structure. The cervical vertebrae are
          notably extremely robust and heavily-built, in contrast to its lightly
          built relatives Diplodocus and Barosaurus. The forelimbs were short
          and stout whereas the hindlimbs were elongated and thick, supported
          respectively by a heavily built shoulder girdle and pelvis. Several
          size estimates have been made, with the largest species B. excelsus
          reaching up to 21–22 m (69–72 ft) from head to tail and weighing in at
          15–17 t (17–19 short tons), whereas the smaller B. parvus only got up
          to 19 m (62 ft) long. Juvenile specimens of Brontosaurus are known,
          with younger individuals growing rapidly to adult size in as little as
          15 years.

        <h2>Tyrannosaurus</h2>

        <p>
          Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include some that are nearly complete
          skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one
          of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed
          significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its
          life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and
          potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its
          taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider
          Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a third Tyrannosaurus species,
          while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other
          genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized
          with Tyrannosaurus. At present, two species of Tyrannosaurus are
          considered valid; the type species, T. rex, and the earlier and more
          recently discovered T. mcraeensis.
